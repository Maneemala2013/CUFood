# CU Food

This is a group project for the course, CSCI3310, Mobile Computing and Applications Development. Our group aims to create an on-campus food-ordering application, which may help students and staff who might be busy with their daily tasks and schedule to have a meal more conveniently. With our application, they can order food from any dining facility on campus. All the canteens and their menus will be available in one application, where canteen administrators can receive orders, change and update the menu, and customers (students and staff) can conveniently order their desired food just like in “Foodpanda” or “Deliveroo”.

Note: This app adapted from CSCI3310 Lab08 - CU Eat @Firebase which is based on the following code.

This is the source code that accompanies the Firestore Android Codelab:

The codelab walked through developing an Android restaurant recommendation app powered by Cloud Firestore.

If you don't want to do the codelab and would rather view the completed sample code, see the Firebase Android Quickstart repository:
